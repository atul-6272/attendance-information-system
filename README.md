# Attendance Information System

This project is a web based application for managing the attendance details for CRRI Temporary employees including casual labours, trainees, SRF & JRF. 
It not only provides ease to the employee while verifying their attendance record and put it on the board  but also helps him/her as well as administrator to keep a proper track of eac and every employee.

It's a combined approach where the employees and admin do not need to maintain large registers and keeps on turning the pages to find the appropriate record instead of that a database can be maintained that can keep thousands or millions of records at the same location.
